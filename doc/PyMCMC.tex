\Abstract{ 

  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation provides a solution to
  the complex integration problems that are faced in the Bayesian
  analysis of statistical problems.  The implementation of MCMC
  algorithms is, however, code intensive and time consuming.  We have
  developed a \proglang{Python} package, which is called \pkg{PyMCMC},
  that aids in the construction of MCMC samplers and helps to
  substantially reduce the likelihood of coding error, as well as aid
  in the minimisation of repetitive code.  \pkg{PyMCMC} contains
  classes for Gibbs, Metropolis Hastings, independent Metropolis
  Hastings, random walk Metropolis Hastings, orientational bias Monte
  Carlo and slice samplers as well as specific modules for common
  models such as a module for Bayesian regression analysis.
  \pkg{PyMCMC} is straightforward to optimise, taking advantage of the
  \proglang{Python} libraries \pkg{Numpy} and \pkg{Scipy}, as well as being
  readily extensible with \proglang{C} or \proglang{Fortran}.

\section{Introduction}

The most common approach currently used in the estimation of Bayesian
Models is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). \pkg{PyMCMC} is a
\proglang{Python} module that is designed to simplify the construction
of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers, without sacrificing
flexibility or performance. \proglang{Python} has extensive scientific
libraries, is easily extensible, has a clean syntax and powerful
programming constructs, making it an ideal programming language to
build an MCMC library; see \citet{Python} for further details on the
programming language \proglang{Python}. \pkg{PyMCMC} contains objects
for the Gibbs sampler, Metropolis Hastings (MH), independent MH,
random walk MH, orientational bias Monte Carlo (OBMC) as well as the
slice sampler: see for example \citet{RobertCassela1999} for details on
standard MCMC algorithms. The user can simply piece together the algorithms
required and can easily include their own modules, where necessary.
Along with the standard algorithms, \pkg{PyMCMC} includes a module for
Bayesian regression analysis. This module can be used for the direct
analysis of linear models, or as a part of an MCMC scheme, where the
conditional posterior has the form of a linear model.  It also
contains a class that can be used along with the Gibbs sampler for
Bayesian variable selection.

% \pkg{PyMCMC} is designed to be fully flexible, with respect to MCMC design.
The flexibility of \pkg{PyMCMC} is important in practice, as MCMC
algorithms usually need to be tailored to the problem of interest in
order to ensure good results.  Issues such as block size and
parameterisation can have a dramatic effect on the convergence of MCMC
sampling schemes. For instance, \citet{LuiKongWong1994} show
theoretically that jointly sampling parameters in a Gibbs scheme
typically leads to a reduction in correlation in the associated Markov
chain in comparison to individually sampling parameters. This is
demonstrated in practical applications in \citet{CarterKohn1994} and
\citet{KimShephardChib1998}. Reducing the correlation in the Markov
chain enables it to move more freely through the parameter space and
as such enables it to escape from local modes in the posterior
distribution. Parameterisation can also have a dramatic effect on the
convergence of MCMC samplers; see for example
\citet{GelfandSahuCarlin1995}, \citet{RobersSahu1997},
\citet{PittShepard1999}, \citet{RobertMengersen1999},
\citet{FruwirthSchnatter2004} and \citet{StricklandMartinForbes2008},
who show that the performance of the sampling schemes can be improved
dramatically with the use of efficient parameterisation.

\pkg{PyMCMC} aims to remove unnecessary repetitive coding and hence
reduce the chance of coding error, and importantly, greatly speed up
the construction of efficient MCMC samplers. This is achieved by
taking advantage of the flexibility of \proglang{Python}, which allows
for the implementation of very general code. Another feature of
\proglang{Python}, which is particularly important, is it is also
extremely easy to include modules from compiled languages such as
\proglang{C} and \proglang{Fortran}. This is important to many
practitioners who are forced, by the size and complexity of their
problems, to write their MCMC programs entirely in compiled languages,
such as \proglang{C/C++} and \proglang{Fortran} in order to obtain the
necessary speed for feasible practical analysis. With
\proglang{Python}, the user can simply compile \proglang{Fortran} code
using a module called \pkg{F2py} \citep{F2PY}, or inline \proglang{C}
using \pkg{Weave}, which is a part of \pkg{Scipy} \citep{NumpyScipy},
and use the subroutines directly from \proglang{Python}. \pkg{F2py}
can also be used to directly call \proglang{C} routines with the aid
of a \proglang{Fortran} signature file. This enables the use of
\pkg{PyMCMC} and \proglang{Python} as a rapid application development
environment, without compromising on performance by requiring only very
small segments of code written in a compiled language. It should be
mentioned that for most reasonable sized problems \pkg{PyMCMC} is
sufficiently fast for practical MCMC analysis without the need for
specialised modules.

\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:Flow-chart-ofPyMCMC} is a flow chart that depicts
the structure of \pkg{PyMCMC}. Essentially, the implementation of an MCMC
sampler can be seen to centred around the class \code{MCMC}, which
acts as a container for various algorithms that are used in sampling
from the conditional posterior distributions that make up the MCMC
sampling scheme. 

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section
\ref{sec:Bayesian-Analysis} the algorithms contained in \pkg{PyMCMC}
and the user interface are described.  This includes the Gibbs
sampler, the Metropolis based algorithms and the slice sampler.
Section \ref{sec:Bayesian-Analysis} also contains a description of the
Bayesian regression module. Section \ref{sec:Empirical-Illustrations}
contains three empirical examples that demonstrate how to use
\pkg{PyMCMC}.  The first example demonstrates how to use the
regression module for the Bayesian analysis of the linear model. In
particular, the stochastic search variable selection algorithm, see
\citet{GeorgeMcCulloch1993} and \citet{MarinRobert2007}, is used to
select a set of `most likely models'. The second example demonstrates
how to use \pkg{PyMCMC} to analyse the loglinear model and the third
example demonstrates how to use \pkg{PyMCMC} to analyse a linear model
with first order autoregressive errors.  Section
\ref{sec:Using-PyMCMC-efficiently} contains discussion on the
efficient implementation of the MCMC algorithms using \pkg{PyMCMC}.
Section \ref{sec:PyMCMC-interacting-with} describes how to use
\pkg{PyMCMC} interactively with \proglang{R} and Section
\ref{sec:Conclusions} concludes.


\section{Bayesian analysis}
\label{sec:Bayesian-Analysis}

Bayesian analysis quantifies information about the unknown parameter
vector of interest, $\bm{\theta},$ for a given data set, $\bm{y},$
through the joint posterior probability density function (pdf),
$p(\bm{\theta}|\bm{y}),$ which is defined such that \begin{equation}
  p(\bm{\theta}|\bm{y})\propto p(\bm{y}|\bm{\theta})\times
  p(\bm{\theta}),\label{eq:joint post}\end{equation} where
$p(\bm{y}|\bm{\theta})$ denotes the pdf of $\bm{y}$ given
$\bm{\theta}$ and $p(\bm{\theta})$ is the prior pdf for $\bm{\theta}.$
The most common approach used for inference about $\bm{\theta}$ is
MCMC.


\subsection{Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and implementation}

In the following subsections, a brief description of each algorithm
and the associated programming interface is included.


\subsubsection{Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling}

If we partition $\bm{\theta}$ into $s$ blocks, that is
$\bm{\bm{\theta}}=\left(\bm{\theta}_{1},\bm{\theta}_{2},\ldots,\bm{\theta}_{s}\right)^{T},$
then the $j^{th}$\ step for a generic MCMC sampling scheme is given
by:

%
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\begin{description}
\item [{\textmd{1.}}] Sample\textbf{\ }$\bm{\theta}_{1}^{j}$ from $p\left(\bm{\theta}_{1}|\bm{y,}\bm{\theta}_{2}^{j-1},\bm{\theta}_{3}^{j-1},\ldots,\bm{\theta}_{s}^{j-1}\right),$ 
\item [{\textmd{2.}}] Sample $\bm{\theta}_{2}^{j}$ from $p\left(\bm{\theta}_{2}|\bm{y,}\bm{\theta}_{1}^{j},\bm{\theta}_{3}^{j-1},\bm{\theta}_{4}^{j-1},\ldots,\bm{\theta}_{s}^{j-1}\right),$

\begin{description}
\item [{$\vdots$}]~
\end{description}
\item [{\textmd{s.}}] Sample $\bm{\theta}_{s}^{j}$ from $p\left(\bm{\theta}_{s}|\bm{y,}\bm{\theta}_{1}^{j},\bm{\theta}_{2}^{j},\ldots,\bm{\theta}_{s-1}^{j}\right).$ 
\end{description}
\caption{Gibbs sampler}
\label{alg:MCMC}
\end{algorithm}

An important special case of Algorithm \ref{alg:MCMC} is the Gibbs
sampler, which is an algorithm that is proposed in
\citet{GelfandSmith1990}. Specifically, when each of
$\bm{\theta}_{1},\bm{\theta}_{2},\dots,\bm{\theta}_{s},$ is sampled
from a closed form then this algorithm corresponds to that of the
Gibbs sampler. \pkg{PyMCMC} contains a class that facilitates the
implementation of Algorithm \ref{alg:MCMC}, in which the user must
define functions to sample from each block, i.e.,. a function for each of
$\bm{\theta}_{i},$ for $i=1,\dots,s.$ These functions may be defined
using the Metropolis based or slice sampling algorithms that are part
of \pkg{PyMCMC}. The class is named \code{MCMC} and the following
arguments are required in the initialisation of the class:

\begin{description}
\item[\code{nit}:]  The number of iterations. 
\item[\code{burn}:]  The burnin length of the MCMC sampler. 
\item[\code{data}:] A dictionary (\proglang{Python} data structure)
  containing any data, functions or objects that the user would like
  to have access to when defining the functions that are called from
  the Gibbs sampler.
\item[\code{blocks}:] A list (\proglang{Python} data structure)
  containing functions that are used to sample from the full
  conditional posterior distributions of interest.
\item[\code{{*}{*}kwargs}] Optional arguments:
  
  \begin{description}
  \item[\code{loglike}] A tuple (a \proglang{Python} data structure)
    containing a function that evaluates the log-likelihood, number of
    parameters and the name of the dataset. For example: \code{loglike
      = (loglike, nparam, `yvec')}.  If this is defined then the
    log-likelihood and the BIC will be reported in the standard
    output.
  \item[\code{transform}] A dictionary, where the keys are the names
    of the parameters and the associated values are functions that
    transform the iterates stored in the MCMC scheme. This can be
    useful when the MCMC algorithm is defined under a particular
    parameterisation, but where it is desirable to report the results
    under a different parameterisation.
  \end{description}
\end{description}
Several functions are included as a part of the class:
\begin{description}
\item \code{sampler()} - Used to run the MCMC sampler. 
\item \code{get\_mean\_cov(listname)} - Returns the posterior
  covariance matrix for the parameters named in \code{listname}, where
  \code{listname} is a list that contains the parameter names of
  interest.
\item \code{get\_parameter(name)} - Returns the iterates for the named
  parameter including the burnin.
\item \code{get\_parameter\_exburn(name)} - Returns the iterates for
  the named parameter excluding the burnin.
\item \code{get\_mean\_var(name)} - Returns the estimate from the MCMC
  estimation for the posterior mean and variance for the parameter
  defined by \code{name}.
\item \code{set\_number\_decimals(num)} - Sets the number of decimal
  places for the output.
\item \code{output({*}{*}kwargs)} - Used to produce output from the
  MCMC algorithm.
  \begin{description}
  \item \code{{*}{*}kwargs} - Optional arguments that control the
    output.
    \begin{description}
    \item \code{parameters}: A dictionary, list or string specifying
      the parameters that are going to be presented.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item If a string is passed (e.g.,: \code{parameters = `beta'}),
        all elements of that parameter are given.
      \item If a list (e.g.,: \code{parameters = {[}`alpha',
          `beta'{]})}, all elements of each parameter in the list are
        given.
      \item If a dictionary (e.g.,: \code{parameters =
          \{`alpha':\{`range':range(5)\}\})}, then there is the
        possibility to add an additional argument \code{`range'} that
        tells the output to only print a subset of the parameters. The
        above example will print information for \code{alpha{[}0{]},
          alpha{[}1{]},..., alpha{[}4{]}} only.
      \end{itemize}
    \item \code{custom} - A user defined function that produces custom
      output.
    \item \code{filename} - A filename to which the output is printed.
      By default output will be printed to stdout.
    \end{description}
   
  \item \code{plot(blockname, {*}{*}kwargs)} - Create summary plots of
    the MCMC sampler.  By default, a plot of the marginal posterior
    density, an ACF plot and a trace plot are produced for each
    parameter in the block. The plotting page is divided into a number
    of subfigures. By default, the number of columns are approximately
    equal to the square root of the total number of subfigures divided
    by the number of different plot types. Arguments to \code{plot} are:

  \begin{description}
  \item \code{blockname} - The name of the parameter, for which summary
    plots are to be generated.
  \item \code{{*}{*}kwargs} - An optional dictionary
    (\proglang{Python} data structure) containing information to
    control the summary plots.  The available keys are summarised
    below:

    \begin{description}
    \item \code{elements}: A list of integers specifying the elements
      that will be plotted. For example, if the blockname is
      \code{`beta'} and
      $\bm{\beta}=(\beta_{0},\beta_{1}\ldots\beta_{n})$ then you may
      specify elements as \code{elements = {[}0,2,5{]}}.
    \item \code{plottypes}: A list giving the type of plot for each
      parameter. By default the plots are \code{`density'},
      \code{`acf'} and \code{`trace'}. A single string is also
      acceptable.
    \item \code{filename}: A string providing the name of an output
      file for the plot.  As a plot of a block may be made up of a
      number of subfigures, the output name will be modified to give a
      separate filename for each subfigure. For example, if the
      filename is passed as \code{`plot.png'}, and there are multiple
      pages of output, it will produce the files \code{plot001.png},
      \code{plot002.png}, etc.  The type of file is determined by the
      extension of the filename, but the output format will also
      depend on the plotting backend being used.  If the filename does
      not have a suffix, a default format will be chosen based on the
      graphics backend. Most backends support png, pdf, ps, eps and
      svg (see the documentation for \pkg{Matplotlib} for further
      details http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net).

    \item \code{individual}: A Boolean option. If true, then each
      subplot will be done on an individual page.
    \item \code{rows}: Integer specifying the number of rows of
      subfigures on a plotting page.
    \item \code{cols}: Integer specifying the number of columns of
      subfigures on a plotting page.
    \end{description}
  \end{description}

\item \code{CODAoutput({*}{*}kwargs)} - Output the results in a format
  suitable for reading in with the statistical package Convergence
  Diagnostic and Output Analysis (\pkg{CODA})
  \citep{Rnews:Plummer+Best+Cowles+Vines:2006}. By default, there will
  be two files created, \code{coda.txt} and \code{coda.ind}.

    \begin{description}
    \item \code{{*}{*}kwargs} - An optional dictionary controlling the
      \pkg{CODA} output.

      \begin{description}
      \item \code{filename}: A string to provide an alternative
        filename for the output.  If the file has an extension this
        will form the basis for the data file and the index file will
        be named by replacing the extension with \code{ind}. If no
        extension is in the filename then two files will be created
        and named by adding the extensions \code{.txt} and \code{.ind}
        to the given filename.
      \item \code{parameters}: A string, a list or a dictionary that
        specify the items written to file. It can be a string such as
        \code{`alpha'} or it can be a list (e.g.,
        \code{{[}`alpha',`beta'{]}}) or it can be a dictionary (e.g., \newline
        \code{\{`alpha':\{`range':{[}0,1,5{]}\}\}}.  If you supply a
        dictionary the key is the parameter name. It is also
        permissible to have a range key with a range of elements. If
        the range isn't supplied it is assumed that the user wants all
        of the elements.
      \item \code{thin}: Integer specifying how to thin the output.
        For examples if \code{thin = 10}, then every tenth element
        will be written to the \pkg{CODA} output.
      \end{description}
    \end{description}
  \end{description}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Metropolis Hastings}
\label{sub:Metropolis-Hastings}

A particularly useful algorithm that is often used as a part of MCMC
samplers is the MH algorithm (Algorithm \ref{alg:MH}); see for example
\citet{RobertCassela1999}. This algorithm is usually required when we
cannot easily sample directly from $p(\bm{\theta}|\bm{y}),$ however,
we have a candidate density
$q(\bm{\theta}|\bm{y},\bm{\theta}^{j-1})$, which
in practice is close to $p(\bm{\theta}|\bm{y}$), and is more readily
able to be sampled. The MH algorithm at the $j^{th}$ iteration for
$j=1,2,\dots,M$ is given by the following steps:

%
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a candidate $\bm{\bm{\theta}}^{\ast}$ from the density $q\left(\bm{\bm{\theta}}|\bm{y},\bm{\theta}^{j-1}\right),$ 
\item Accept $\bm{\theta}^{j}=\bm{\theta}^{\ast}$ with probability equal
to $\min\left\{ 1,\frac{p\left(\bm{\theta}^{\ast}|\bm{y}\right)}{p\left(\bm{\theta}^{j-1}|\bm{y}\right)}/\frac{q\left(\bm{\theta}^{\ast}|\bm{y},\bm{\theta}^{j-1}\right)}{q\left(\bm{\theta}^{j-1}|\bm{y},\bm{\theta}^{*}\right)}\right\} ,$ 
\item Otherwise $\bm{\theta}^{j}=\bm{\theta}^{j-1}.$ 
\end{enumerate}
\caption{Metropolis Hastings}
\label{alg:MH}
\end{algorithm}


\pkg{PyMCMC} includes a class for the MH algorithm, which is called
\code{MH}.  To initialise the class the user needs to define:
\begin{description} 
\item \code{func} - User defined function that returns a sample for
  the parameter of interest.
\item \code{actualprob} - User defined function that returns the log
  probability of the parameters of interest evaluated using the target
  density.
\item \code{probcandprev} - User defined function that returns the log
  of $q\left(\bm{\theta}^{\ast}|\bm{y},\bm{\theta}^{j-1}\right).$
\item \code{probprevcand} - User defined function that returns the log
  of $q\left(\bm{\theta}^{j-1}|\bm{y},\bm{\theta}^{*}\right).$
\item \code{init\_theta} - Initial value for the parameters of
  interest.
\item \code{name} - The name of the parameter of interest.
\item \code{{*}{*}kwargs} - Optional arguments:

  \begin{description}
  \item \code{store}
    \begin{description}  
    \item \code{`all'} (default), stores every iterate for the parameter
      of interest. This is required for certain calculations.
    \item \code{`none'}, does not store any of the iterates from the parameter of
      interest.
    \end{description}
  \item \code{fixed\_parameter} - Is used if the user wants to fix the
    parameter value that is returned. This is used for testing MCMC
    sampling schemes.  This command will override any other
    functionality.
  \end{description}
\end{description}
\subsubsection{Independent Metropolis Hastings}

The independent MH is a special case of the MH 
described in Algorithm \ref{alg:MH}. Specifically, the
independent MH algorithm is applicable when we have a candidate
density
$q(\bm{\theta}|\bm{y})=q(\bm{\theta}|\bm{y},\bm{\theta}^{j-1})$.  The
independent MH algorithm at the $j^{th}$ iteration for
$j=1,2,\ldots,M$ is given by Algorithm \ref{alg:IMH}.

%
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw a candidate $\bm{\bm{\theta}}^{\ast}$ from the density $q\left(\bm{\bm{\theta}}|\bm{y}\right),$ 
\item Accept $\bm{\theta}^{j}=\bm{\theta}^{\ast}$ with probability equal
to $\min\left\{ 1,\frac{p\left(\bm{\theta}^{\ast}|\bm{y}\right)}{p\left(\bm{\theta}^{j-1}|\bm{y}\right)}/\frac{q\left(\bm{\theta}^{\ast}|\bm{y}\right)}{q\left(\bm{\theta}^{j-1}|\bm{y}\right)}\right\} ,$ 
\item Otherwise accept $\bm{\theta}^{j}=\bm{\theta}^{j-1}.$ 
\end{enumerate}
\caption{Independent MH algorithm}
\label{alg:IMH}
\end{algorithm}


\pkg{PyMCMC} contains a class for the independent MH algorithm, named
\code{IndMH}.  To initialise the class the user needs to define:
\begin{description}
\item \code{func} - A user defined function that returns a sample for
  the parameter of interest.
\item \code{actualprob} - A user defined function that returns the log
  probability of the parameters of interest evaluated using the target
  density.
\item \code{candpqrob} - A user defined function that returns the log
  probability of the parameters of interest evaluated using the
  candidate density.
\item \code{init\_theta} - Initial value for the parameters of interest.
\item \code{name} - Name of the parameter of interest.
\item \code{{*}{*}kwargs}- Optional arguments:

\begin{description}
\item \code{store}
  \begin{description}
  \item \code{`all'} (default), stores every iterate for the parameter
    of interest. This is required for certain calculations.
  \item \code{`none'}, does not store any of the iterates from the parameter
    of interest.
  \end{description}
\item \code{fixed\_parameter} - Is used if the user wants to fix the
    parameter value that is returned. This is used for testing MCMC
    sampling schemes.  This command will override any other
    functionality.
  \end{description}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Random walk Metropolis Hastings}


A useful and simple way to construct an MH candidate distribution is
via\begin{equation}
  \bm{\theta}^{\ast}=\bm{\theta}^{j-1}+\bm{\bm{\varepsilon}},\label{random
    walk candidate}\end{equation} where $\bm{\varepsilon}$ is a random
disturbance vector. If $\bm{\varepsilon}$ has a distribution that is
symmetric about zero then the MH algorithm has a specific form that is
referred to as the random walk\textbf{\ }MH algorithm. In this case,
note that the candidate density is both independent of $\bm{y}$ and,
due to symmetry, \textbf{\
}$q\left(\bm{\theta}^{\ast}|\bm{\theta}^{j-1}\right)=q\left(\bm{\theta}^{j-1}|\bm{\theta}^{\ast}\right)$.
The random walk MH algorithm at the $j^{th}$ iteration for
$j=1,2,\ldots,M$ is given\emph{\ }by Algorithm \ref{alg:rwmh}.

%
\begin{algorithm}[H]
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Draw a candidate $\bm{\theta}^{\ast}$ from
    Equation~\ref{random walk candidate} where the random disturbance
    $\bm{\varepsilon}$ has a distribution symmetric about zero.
  \item Accept $\bm{\theta}^{j}=\bm{\theta}^{\ast}$ with probability
    equal to $\min\left\{
      1,\frac{p\left(\bm{\theta}^{\ast}|\bm{y}\right)}{p\left(\bm{\theta}^{j-1}|\bm{y}\right)}\right\}
    $,
  \item Otherwise accept $\bm{\theta}^{j}=\bm{\theta}^{j-1}.$
  \end{enumerate}
  \caption{Random Walk MH}
\label{alg:rwmh}
\end{algorithm}


A typical choice for the distribution of $\bm{\bm{\varepsilon}}$ is a
Normal distribution,\emph{\ }that is $\bm{\varepsilon\sim}i.i.d.$
$\bm{N}\left(0,\bm{\Omega}\right)\ $ where the covariance matrix
$\bm{\Omega}$ is viewed as a tuning parameter. \pkg{PyMCMC} includes a
class for the random walk MH algorithm, named \code{RWMH}. The class
\code{RWMH} is defined assuming $\bm{\varepsilon}$ follows a normal
distribution. Note that more general random walk MH algorithms could
be constructed using the MH class. To initialise the class the user
must specify:
\begin{description}
\item \code{post} - A user defined function for the log of full
  conditional posterior distribution for the parameters of interest.
\item \code{csig} - Scale parameter for the random walk MH algorithm.
\item \code{init\_theta} - Initial value for the parameter of interest.
\item \code{name} - Name of the parameter of interest.
\item \code{**kwargs} - Optional arguments:

  \begin{description}
  \item \code{store}
    \begin{description}
    \item \code{`all'} (default), stores every iterate for the
      parameter of interest. This is required for certain
      calculations.
    \item \code{`none'}, does not store any of the iterates from the
      parameter of interest.
    \end{description}
  \item \code{fixed\_parameter} - Is used if the user wants to fix the
    parameter value that is returned. This is used for testing MCMC
    sampling schemes.  This command will override any other
    functionality.
  \item \code{adaptive} - \code{`GYS'}, Then the adaptive random walk
    MH algorithm of \citet{GarthwaiteYanScisson2010} will be used to
    optimise $\bm{\Omega}.$
  \end{description}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Orientational bias Monte Carlo}

The multiple try Metropolis \citep{LuiLiangWong2000} generalises the
MH algorithm to allow for multiple proposals. The OBMC algorithm is a
special case of the multiple try Metropolis that is applicable when he
candidate density is symmetric. The OBMC Algorithm at iteration $j$ is
as follows:

%
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Draw $L$ candidates $\bm{\theta}_{l}^{\ast},$ $l=1,2,\ldots,L$,
  independently from the density
  $q\left(\bm{\theta}|\bm{y},\bm{\theta}^{j-1}\right)$, where
  $q\left(\bm{\theta}|\bm{y},\bm{\theta}^{j-1}\right)$ is a symmetric
  function.
\item Construct a \textit{probability mass function (pmf)} by
  assigning to each\emph{\ }$\bm{\theta}_{l}^{\ast},$ a probability
  proportional to $p\left(\bm{\theta}_{l}^{\ast}|\bm{y}\right).$
\item Select $\bm{\theta}^{\ast\ast}$ randomly from this discrete
  distribution.
\item Draw $L-1$ reference points $\bm{r}_{l},$
  $l=1,2,\ldots,L-1$,\textbf{\ }independently from
  $q\left(\bm{\theta}|\bm{y},\bm{\theta}^{\ast\ast}\right)$ and set
  $\bm{r}_{L}=\bm{\theta}^{j-1}.$
\item Accept $\bm{\theta}^{j}=\bm{\theta}^{\ast\ast}$ with probability
  equal to $\min\left\{
    1,\frac{\sum_{l=1}^{L}p\left(\bm{\theta}_{l}^{\ast}|\bm{y}\right)}{\sum_{l=1}^{L}p\left(\bm{r}_{l}|\bm{y}\right)}\right\}
  $,
\item Otherwise accept $\bm{\theta}^{j}=\bm{\theta}^{j-1}.$
\end{enumerate}
\caption{Orientational Bias Monte Carlo}
\label{alg:obmc}
\end{algorithm}


\pkg{PyMCMC} implements a special case of the OBMC algorithm, for
which the candidate density is multivariate normal, making it a
generalisation of the random walk MH algorithm. The class for the OBMC
algorithm is named \code{OBMC}. To initialise the class the user must
specify:
\begin{description}
\item \code{post} - A user defined function for the log of the full
  conditional posterior distribution for the parameters of interest.
\item \code{ntry} - Number of candidates, $L$.
\item \code{csig} - A scale parameter for the OBMC algorithm.
\item \code{init\_theta} - Initial value for the parameter of interest. 
\item \code{{*}{*}kwargs} - Optional arguments:

  \begin{description}
  \item \code{store}
    \begin{description}
    \item \code{`all'} (default), stores every iterate for the
      parameter of interest. This is required for certain
      calculations.
    \item \code{`none'}, does not store any of the iterates from the
      parameter of interest.
      \end{description}
    \item \code{fixed\_parameter} - Is used if the user wants to fix
      the parameter value that is returned. This is used for testing
      MCMC sampling schemes.  This command will override any other
      functionality.
  \end{description}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Closed form sampler}

A class is included so that the user can specify a function to sample
the parameters of interest when there is a closed form solution. The
name of the class is \code{CFsampler}. To initialise the class the
user must specify:
\begin{description}
\item \code{func} - User defined function that samples from the
  posterior distribution of interest.
\item \code{init\_theta} - Initial value for the unknown parameter of
  interest.
\item \code{name} - The name of the parameter of interest.
\item \code{{*}{*}kwargs} - Optional parameters:

\begin{description}
\item \code{store}
  \begin{description}
  \item \code{`all'} (default), stores every iterate for the parameter
    of interest. This is required for certain calculations.
  \item `none', does not store any of the iterates from the parameter
    of interest.
  \end{description}
\item \code{fixed\_parameter} - Is used if the user wants to fix the
  parameter value that is returned. This is used for testing MCMC
  sampling schemes.  This command will override any other
  functionality.
\end{description}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Slice sampler}

The slice sampler is useful for drawing values from complex densities;
see \citet{Radford2003} for further details. The required distribution
must be proportional to one or a multiple of several other functions
of the variable of interest;

\[p(\theta)\propto f_{1}(\theta)f_{2}(\theta)\cdots f_{n}(\theta).\]

A set of values from the distribution is obtained by iteratively
sampling a new value, $\omega,$ from the vertical \emph{slice} between
0 and $f_{i}(\theta)$, then sampling a value for the parameter
$\theta$ from the horizontal \emph{slice} that consists of the set of
possible values of $\theta$, for which the previously sampled
$\omega\le p(\theta)$.  This leads to the slice sampler algorithm,
which can be defined at iteration $j$ using Algorithm
\ref{alg:slicesamp}.

%
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\begin{enumerate}
\item For $i=1,2,\dots,n$, draw $\omega_{i}\sim\mbox{Unif}[0,f_{i}(\theta^{j-1})]$. 
\item Sample $\theta^{j}\sim\mbox{Unif}[A]$ where $A=\left\{ \theta:f_{1}(\theta)\ge\omega_{1}\in f_{2}(\theta)\ge\omega_{2}\in\cdots\in f_{n}(\theta)\ge\omega_{n}\right\} $. 
\end{enumerate}
\caption{Slice sampler}
\label{alg:slicesamp}
\end{algorithm}


In cases where the density of interest is not unimodal, determining
the exact set $A$ is not necessarily straightforward. The
\emph{stepping out} algorithm of \citet{Radford2003} is used to obtain
the set $A$.  This algorithm is applied to each of the $n$ slices to
obtain the joint maximum and minimum of the slice. This results in a
sampling interval that is designed to draw a new $\theta^{j}$ in the
neighbourhood of $\theta^{j-1}$ and may include values outside the
permissible range of $A$. The user is required to define an estimated
typical slice size ($ss$), which is the width of set $A$, along with
an integer value ($N$), which limits the width of any slice to $N\times ss$.
The stepping out algorithm (\ref{alg:steppingout}) is:

%
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\begin{enumerate}
\item Initiate lower (LB) and upper (UB) bounds for slice defined by set
$A$.\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
\item $U\sim\mbox{Unif}(0,1)$; 

\begin{itemize}
\item $LB=\theta^{j-1}-ss{\times}U$, 
\item $UB=LB+ss$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sample $V\sim\mbox{Unif}(0,1)$. 
\item Set $J=\mbox{Floor}(N{\times}V)$. 
\item Set $Z=(N-1)-J$. 
\item Repeat while $J>0$ and $\omega_{i}<f_{i}(LB)\forall i$;

\begin{itemize}
\item LB = LB - $ss$, 
\item $J=J-1$. 
\end{itemize}
\item Repeat while $Z>0$ and $\omega_{i}<f_{i}(UB)\forall i$;

\begin{itemize}
\item UB = UB + ss, 
\item Z = Z - 1. 
\end{itemize}
\item Sample $\theta^{j}\sim\mbox{Unif}(LB,UB)$. 
\end{enumerate}
\caption{Stepping out}
\label{alg:steppingout}
\end{algorithm}


The value of $\theta^{j}$ is accepted if it is drawn from a range
$(LB,UB)\in A$. If it is outside the allowable range due to the
interval $(LB,UB)$ being larger in range than the set $A$ we then
invoke a shrinkage technique to resample $\theta^{j}$ and improve the
sampling efficiency of future draws, until an acceptable $\theta^{j}$
is drawn.  The shrinkage algorithm is implemented as follows,
repeating this algorithm until exit conditions are met.

%
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\begin{enumerate}
\item $U\sim\mbox{Unif}(0,1)$. 
\item $\theta^{j}=LB+U{\times}(UB-LB)$;

\begin{itemize}
\item If $\omega_{i}<f_{i}(\omega_{i})\forall i$, accept $\theta^{j}$
and exit, 
\item Else if $\theta^{j}<\theta^{j-1}$, set $LB=\theta^{j}$ and return
to step 1, 
\item Else set $UB=\theta^{j}$ and return to step 1. 
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\caption{Shrinkage}
\label{alg:shrinkage}
\end{algorithm}


\pkg{PyMCMC} includes a class for the slice sampler named
\code{SliceSampler.  }To initialise the class the user must define:
\begin{description}
\item \code{func} - A $k$ dimensional list containing the set of log
  functions.
\item \code{init\_theta} - An initial value for $\theta$.
\item \code{ssize} - A user defined value for the typical slice size.
\item \code{sN} - An integer limiting slice size to $N\times ss$.
\item \code{{*}{*}kwargs} - Optional arguments:
   
  \begin{description}
  \item \code{store}
    \begin{description}
    \item \code{`all'} (default), stores every iterate for the
      parameter of interest. This is required for certain
      calculations.
    \item \code{`none'}, does not store any of the iterates from the
      parameter of interest.
    \end{description}
  \item \code{fixed\_parameter} - Is used if the user wants to fix the
    parameter value that is returned. This is used for testing MCMC
    sampling schemes.  This command will override any other
    functionality.

\end{description}

\subsection{Normal linear Bayesian regression model}
\label{sec: Regression Model}

Many interesting models are partly linear for a subset of the unknown
parameters. As such drawing from the full conditional posterior
distribution for the associated parameters may be equivalent to
sampling the unknown parameters in a standard linear regression model.
\pkg{PyMCMC} includes several classes that aid in the analysis of
linear or partly linear models. In particular the classes
\code{BayesRegression}, \code{CondRegBetaSampler},
\code{CondScaleSampler} and \code{StochasticSearch} are useful for
this purpose. These classes are described in this section.  For the
standard linear regression model (see \citet{Zellner1971}, assume the
$\left(n\times1\right)$ observational vector, $\bm{y},$ is generated
according to\begin{equation}
  \bm{y}=\bm{X}\bm{\beta}+\bm{\varepsilon};\,\,\,\bm{\varepsilon}\sim
  N(\bm{0},\sigma^{2}\bm{I}),\label{eq:regression}
\end{equation} where
$\bm{X}$ is an $(n\times k)$ matrix of regressors, $\bm{\beta}$ is a
$\left(k\times1\right)$ vector of regression coefficients and
$\bm{\varepsilon}$ is a normally distributed random variable with a
mean vector $\bm{0}$ and an $\left(n\times n\right)$ covariance
matrix, $\sigma^{2}\bm{I}.$ Assuming that both $\bm{\beta}$ and
$\sigma$ are unknown then the posterior distribution for Equation~\ref{eq:regression} is given by\begin{equation}
  p(\bm{\beta},\sigma|\bm{y},\bm{X})\propto
  p(\bm{y}|\bm{X},\bm{\beta},\sigma)\times
  p(\bm{\beta},\sigma),\label{eq:post regression}
\end{equation} where
\begin{equation}
  p(\bm{y}|\bm{X},\bm{\beta},\sigma)\propto\sigma^{-n}\exp\left\{
    -\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)^{T}\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)\right\}
  ,\label{eq:likelihood regression}
\end{equation} is the joint
\emph{pdf} for $\bm{y}$ given $\bm{X}$, $\bm{\beta}$ and
$\sigma$, and\emph{ $p(\bm{\beta},\sigma)$ } denotes the joint
prior \emph{pdf} for $\bm{\beta}$ and $\sigma$.

A class named \code{BayesRegression} is defined to sample from the
posterior distribution in Equation~\ref{eq:post regression}. One of
four alternative priors may be used in the specification of the model.
The default choice is Jeffreys prior. Denoting the full set of unknown
parameters as $\bm{\theta}=(\bm{\beta}^{T},\sigma)^{T},$ then Jeffreys
prior is defined such that
\begin{equation}
  p(\bm{\theta})\propto|I(\bm{\theta})|^{-1/2},\label{eq:Jeffrey's
    Prior}
\end{equation} 
where $I(\bm{\theta})$ is the Fisher information matrix for
$\bm{\theta}.$ For the normal linear regression model in
\ref{eq:regression}, given the assumption that $\beta$ and $\sigma$
are \emph{a priori} independent, Jeffreys prior is flat over the
real number line for $\beta$, and $\sigma$ is distributed such
that
\begin{equation}
		p\left(\sigma\right)\propto\frac{1}{\sigma}.
\end{equation}
See \cite{Zellner1971} for further details on Jeffreys prior. Three
alternative informative prior specifications are allowed, namely the
normal-gamma, the normal-inverted-gamma and Zellner's g-prior; see
\cite{Zellner1971} and \cite{MarinRobert2007} for further details.
The normal-gamma prior is specified such that
\begin{equation}
  \bm{\beta}|\kappa\sim
  N(\bm{\underline{\beta}},\underline{\bm{V}}^{-1}),\,\,\,\kappa\sim
  G\left(\frac{\underline{\nu}}{2},\frac{\underline{S}}{2}\right),\label{eq:Normal
    Gamma}
\end{equation} 
where $\kappa=\sigma^{-2}$ and $\underline{\beta,}$
$\underline{\bm{V}},$ $\underline{\nu}$ and $\underline{S}$ are prior
hyperparameters that take user defined values. For the Normal-gamma
prior, \code{BayesRegression} produces estimates for\emph{
  $\left(\kappa,\bm{\beta}^{T}\right)^{T}$ }rather than
$\left(\sigma,\bm{\beta}^{T}\right)$ . The Normal-inverted gamma prior
is specified such that
\begin{equation}
  \bm{\beta}|\sigma^{-2}\sim
  N(\bm{\underline{\beta}},\underline{\bm{V}}^{-1}),\,\,\,\sigma^{-2}\sim
  IG\left(\frac{\underline{\nu}}{2},\frac{\underline{S}}{2}\right),\label{eq:Normal
    Inverted Gamma}
\end{equation} 
where $\underline{\beta,}$ $\underline{\bm{V}},$ $\underline{\nu}$ and
$\underline{S}$ are prior hyperparameters, which take values that are
set by the user. Zellner's g-prior is specified such that
\begin{equation} \bm{\beta}|\sigma\sim
  N\left(\underline{\bm{\beta}},g\sigma^{2}\left(X^{T}X\right)^{-1}\right),\,\,\,
  p(\sigma)\propto\sigma^{-1},\label{eq:g-prior}
\end{equation}
where $\bm{\underline{\beta}}$ and $g$ are hyperparameters with values
that are specified by the user. To initialise the class
\code{BayesRegression} the user must specify:
\begin{description}
\item \code{yvec} - One dimensional \pkg{Numpy} array containing the
  data.
\item \code{xmat} - Two dimensional \pkg{Numpy} array contain the
  regressors.
\item \code{{*}{*}kwargs} - Optional arguments:

  \begin{description}
  \item \code{prior} - A list containing the name of the prior and the
    corresponding hyperparameters. Examples: \newline
     \code{prior = {[}`normal\_gamma', betaubar, Vubar, nuubar, Subar{]}}
     ,\newline
    \code{prior = {[}`normal\_inverted\_gamma',betaubar, Vubar,
      nuubar, Subar{]}} and \newline
    \code{prior = {[}`g\_prior', betaubar,
      g{]}}. \newline
    If none of these options are chosen or they are
    miss-specified then the default prior will be Jeffreys prior.
  \end{description}
\end{description}
\code{BayesRegression} contains several functions that may be of
interest to the user. In particular:
\begin{description}
\item \code{sample()} - Returns a sample of $\sigma$ and $\bm{\beta}$
  from the joint posterior distribution for the normal-inverted gamma
  prior, Jeffreys prior and Zellner's g-prior. If the normal-gamma
  prior is specified then \code{sample()} returns $\kappa$ and
  $\bm{\beta}.$
\item \code{update\_yvec(yvec)} - Updates yvec in
  \code{BayesRegression}. This is often useful when the class is being
  used as a part of the MCMC sampling scheme.
\item \code{update\_xmat(xmat)} - Updates xmat in
  \code{BayesRegression}. This is often useful when the class is being
  used as a part of the MCMC sampling scheme.
\item \code{loglike(scale, beta)} - Returns the log-likelihood.
\item \code{posterior\_mean()} - Returns the posterior mean for the
  scale parameter (either $\sigma$ or $\kappa$ depending on the
  specified prior) and $\bm{\beta}.$
\item \code{get\_posterior\_covmat()} - Returns the posterior
  covariance matrix for $\bm{\beta}$.
\item \code{bic()} - Returns the Bayesian information criterion; see
  \cite{KassRaftery1995} for details.
\item \code{plot({*}{*}kwargs)} - Produces standard plots.
  Specifically the marginal posterior density intervals for each
  element of $\bm{\beta}$ and for the scale parameter ($\sigma$ or
  $\kappa)$.
\item \code{residuals} - Returns the residual vector from the
  regression analysis.  The residuals are calculated with $\bm{\beta}$
  evaluated at the marginal posterior mean.
\item \code{output} - Produces standard output for the regression
  analysis.  This includes the means, standard deviations and highest
  posterior density (HPD) intervals for the marginal posterior
  densities for each element of $\bm{\beta}$ and for the scale
  parameter ($\sigma$ or $\kappa)$. The output also reports the
  log-likelihood and the BIC.
\end{description}
In MCMC sampling schemes it is common that for a subset of the unknown
parameters of interest the full conditional posterior distribution
will correspond to that of a linear regression model, where the scale
parameter is known. For the linear regression model specified in
Equation~\ref{eq:regression} the posterior distribution for the case that
$\sigma$ is known is as follows
\begin{equation} 
p\left(\bm{\beta}|\bm{y},\bm{X},\bm{\beta},\sigma\right)\propto
  p(\bm{y}|\bm{X},\bm{\beta},\sigma)\times
  p(\bm{\beta}),\label{eq:post_condbeta}
\end{equation} where
$p(\bm{y}|\bm{X},\bm{\beta},\sigma)$ is described in
Equation~\ref{eq:likelihood regression} and $p(\bm{\beta})$ is the prior
\emph{pdf} for $\bm{\beta}.$ To sample from Equation~\ref{eq:post_condbeta} a
class named \code{CondBetaRegSampler} can be used. The user may
specify one of three alternative priors.  The default prior is
Jeffreys prior, which for $\bm{\beta}$ is simply a flat prior over
the real number line. A normally distributed prior for $\bm{\beta}$ is
another option, and can be specified such that\[ \bm{\beta}\sim
N\left(\underline{\beta},\bm{V}^{-1}\right).\] The user may also
specify their \emph{a priori} beliefs using Zellner's g-prior, where\[
\bm{\beta}|\sigma\sim
N\left(\bm{\beta},g\sigma^{2}\bm{X}^{T}\bm{X}\right).\] To initialise
the class the user must specify:
\begin{description}
\item \code{yvec} - A one dimensional \pkg{Numpy} array containing the
  data.
\item \code{xmat} - A two dimensional \pkg{Numpy} array containing the
  regressors.
\item \code{{*}{*}kwargs} - Optional arguments:

\begin{description}
\item \code{prior} - A list containing the name of the prior and the
  corresponding hyperparameters. Examples: \newline
  \code{prior={[}`normal', betaubar, Vubar{]} or {[}`g\_prior',
    betaubar, g{]}}. \newline If none of these options are chosen or
  they are miss-specified then the default prior will be Jeffreys
  prior.
\end{description}
\end{description}
\code{CondBetaRegSampler} contains several functions that may be of
interest to the user. In particular:

\begin{description}

\item \code{sample(sigma)} - Returns a sample of $\bm{\beta}$ from the
  posterior distribution specified in \ref{eq:post_condbeta}.
\item \code{get\_marginal\_posterior\_mean()} - Returns the marginal
  posterior mean for \ref{eq:post_condbeta}.
\item \code{get\_marginal\_posterior\_precision()} - Returns the
  marginal posterior precision for the linear conditional posterior
  distribution specified in \ref{eq:post_condbeta}.
\item \code{update\_yvec(yvec)} - Updates yvec in
  \code{CondBetaRegSampler}. This is often useful when the class is
  being used as a part of an MCMC sampling scheme.
\item \code{update\_xmat(xmat)} - Updates xmat in
  \code{CondBetaRegSampler}. This is often useful when the class is
  being used as a part of an MCMC sampling scheme.
\end{description}
Many Bayesian models contain linear components with unknown scale
parameters, hence a class has been specified named
\code{CondScaleSampler}, which can be used to individually sample
scale parameters from their posterior distributions. In particular, we
wish to sample from
\begin{equation} p(\sigma|\bm{y},\bm{\theta}),\label{eq:posterior
    sigma}
\end{equation} where $\bm{\theta}$ is the set of unknown
parameters of interest excluding $\sigma.$ The user may choose to use
one of three priors.  The Jeffreys prior, which for $\sigma$ given
the posterior in Equation~\ref{eq:posterior sigma} is as follows \[
p(\sigma)\propto\frac{1}{\sigma}.\] The second option is to specify an
inverted-gamma prior, such that\[ \sigma\sim
IG\left(\frac{\underline{\nu}}{2},\frac{\underline{S}}{2}\right).\]
Alternatively, the user may specify a gamma prior for
$\kappa=\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}},$ where\[ \kappa\sim
G\left(\frac{\underline{\nu}}{2},\frac{\underline{S}}{2}\right).\] To
initialise the class \code{CondScaleSamper} the user may first
specify:
\begin{description}
\item \code{{*}{*}kwargs} - Options arguments:
\begin{description}
\item \code{prior} - List containing the name of the prior and the
  corresponding hyperparameters. Examples: \newline
  \code{prior={[}`gamma',nuubar,subar{]}} or \newline
  \code{prior={[}`inverted-gamma', nuubar, subar{]}}. If no prior is
  specified the Jeffreys prior is used.
\end{description}
\end{description}
\pkg{PyMCMC} also includes another class that can be used for the
direct analysis of the linear regression model. The class is called
\code{StochasticSearch} and can be used in conjunction with the class
\code{MCMC}, for the purpose of variable selection.

The stochastic search algorithm can be used for variable selection in
the linear regression model. Given a set of $k$ possible regressors
there are $2^{k}$ models to choose from. The stochastic search
algorithm, as proposed by \citet{GeorgeMcCulloch1993}, uses the Gibbs
sampler to select a set of `most likely' models. The stochastic search
algorithm is implemented in the class \code{StochasticSearch}. The
specific implementation follows \citet{MarinRobert2007}. The algorithm
introduces the vector $\bm{\gamma},$ which is used to select the
explanatory variables that are to be included in the model. In
particular, $\bm{\gamma}$ is defined to be a binary vector of order
$k$, whereby the inclusion of the $i^{th}$regressor implies that the
$i^{th}$element of $\bm{\gamma}$ is a one, whilst the exclusion of the
$i^{th}$ regressor implies that the $i^{th}$ element is zero.  It is
assumed that the first element of the design matrix is always included
and should typically be a column of ones which is used to represent
the constant or intercept in the regression. The algorithm specified
to sample $\bm{\gamma}$ is a single move Gibbs sampling scheme; for
further details see \citet{MarinRobert2007}.

To use the class \code{StochasticSearch }the user must specify their
\emph{a priori} beliefs that the unknown parameters of interest,
$(\sigma,\bm{\beta}^{T})^{T},$ are distributed following Zellner's
g-prior, which is described in Equation~\ref{eq:g-prior}.
\code{StochasticSearch }is designed to be used in conjunction with the
MCMC sampling class. To initialise \code{StochasticSearch} the user
must specify:
\begin{description}
\item \code{yvec} - One dimensional \pkg{Numpy} array containing the
  dependent variable.
\item \code{xmat} - Two dimensional \pkg{Numpy} array containing the
  regressors.
\item \code{prior} - List with the following structure
  \code{{[}betaubar, g{]}}.
\end{description}
The class \code{StochasticSearch} also contains the following
function:
\begin{description}
\item \code{sample\_gamma(store)} - Returns a sample of $\bm{\gamma}.$
  The only argument to pass into the function \code{sample\_gamma} is
  the storage dictionary that is passed by default to each of the
  classes that are called from the class \code{MCMC }in \pkg{PyMCMC}.
\end{description}

\section{Empirical illustrations}
\label{sec:Empirical-Illustrations}

\pkg{PyMCMC} is illustrated though three examples. Specifically, a
linear regression example with variable selection, a log-linear
example and a linear regression model with first order autoregressive
errors.  For each example, the model of interest is specified, then
the code used for estimation is shown, following which a brief
description of code is given. Each example uses the module for
\pkg{PyMCMC}, along with the \proglang{Python} libraries \pkg{Numpy},
\pkg{Scipy} and \pkg{Matplotlib}: see \citet{NumpyScipy, Matplotlib}
for further details of these Python libraries.  Example 3 further uses
the library \pkg{Pysparse} \citep{geus11}.


\subsection{Example 1: Linear regression model: Variable selection and
  estimation}

The data used in this example are a response of crop yield modelled
using various chemical measurements from the soil. As the results of
the chemical analysis of soil cores are done in a laboratory, many
input variables are available and the data analyst would like to
determine the variables that are most appropriate to use in the model.

The normal linear regression model in Equation~\ref{eq:regression} is used
for the analysis.  To select the set of `most probable'
regressors we use the stochastic search variable selection approach
described in Section \ref{sec: Regression Model} using a subset of 19
explanatory variables.

%%\subsubsection{Example code: Variable selection in regression}

In addition to \pkg{PyMCMC}, this example uses functions from
\pkg{Numpy}, so the first step is to import the relevant packages:

\begin{Code}
import os
from numpy import loadtxt, hstack, ones, random, zeros, asfortranarray, log
from pymcmc.mcmc import MCMC, CFsampler
from pymcmc.regtools import StochasticSearch, BayesRegression
\end{Code}

The remaining code is typically organised so that the user defined
functions are at the top and the main program is at the bottom.  We
begin by defining functions that are called from the class
\code{MCMC}, all of which take the argument \code{store}. In this
example there is one such function:

\begin{Code}
def samplegamma(store):
    return store['SS'].sample_gamma(store)
\end{Code}
In this case, \code{samplegamma} simply uses the predefined function
available in the \code{StochasticSearch} class to sample from
$\gamma$. 

The data and an instance of the class \code{StochasticSearch} are now
initialised:
\begin{Code}
data = loadtxt('yld2.txt')
yvec = data[:, 0]
xmat = data[:, 1:20]
xmat = hstack([ones((xmat.shape[0], 1)), xmat])
data ={'yvec':yvec, 'xmat':xmat}

prior = ['g_prior', zeros(xmat.shape[1]), 100.]
SSVS = StochasticSearch(yvec, xmat, prior);
data['SS'] = SSVS
\end{Code}


Notice that \code{data} is augmented to include the class instance for
\code{StochasticSearch}.  In this example we use Zellner's g-prior with
$\bm{\underline{\beta}} = 0$ and $g=100$. The normal-inverted-gamma
prior could also be used.

The next step is to initialise $\gamma$ and set up the appropriate
sampler for the model. In this case, as the full conditionals are
of closed form, we can use the \code{CFsampler} class:

\begin{Code}
initgamma = zeros(xmat.shape[1], dtype ='i')
initgamma[0] = 1
simgam = CFsampler(samplegamma, initgamma, 'gamma')
\end{Code}

The required arguments to \code{CFSampler} are a function that samples
from the posterior \newline (\code{samplegamma}), the initial value
for $\gamma$ (\code{initgamma}) and the name of the parameter of
interest (\code{`gamma'}). The single argument to \code{samplegamma},
\code{store}, is a dictionary (\proglang{Python} data structure) that
is passed to all functions that are called from the MCMC sampler.  The
purpose of \code{store} is to contain all the data required to define
functions that sample from, or are used in the evaluation of, the
posterior distribution. For example, we see that \code{samplegamma}
accesses \code{store[`SS']}, which contains the class instance for
\code{StochasticSearch}. In addition to all the information contained
in \code{data}, \code{store} contains the value of the previous
iterate for each block of the MCMC scheme. It is possible, for
example, to access the current iteration for any named parameter (in
this case \code{`gamma'}) from any of the functions called from MCMC
by using \code{store[`gamma']}. This feature is not used in this
example, but can be seen in the proceding examples.

The actual sampling is done by setting a random seed and running the
MCMC sampler:
\begin{Code}
random.seed(12346)
ms = MCMC(20000, 5000, data, [simgam])
ms.sampler()
\end{Code}

The \code{MCMC} sampler is initialised by setting the number of
iterations (20000), the burnin (5000), providing the data dictionary
\code{data} and a list containing the information used to sample from
the full conditional posterior distributions. In this case, this list
consists a single element, \code{simgam}, the \code{CFsampler}
instance.

The default output from the \code{MCMC} object is a summary of each
parameter providing the posterior mean, posterior standard deviation,
95\% credible intervals and inefficiency factors. This can output
directly to screen, or captured in an output file. A sample of this
output, giving only the first four elements of $\gamma$ is:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
ms.output()
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
--------------------------------------------------------

The time (seconds) for the MCMC sampler =  7.4
Number of blocks in MCMC sampler =  1

                    mean          sd         2.5%       97.5%      IFactor
    gamma[0]           1           0            1           1         NA
    gamma[1]      0.0929        0.29            0           1         3.75
    gamma[2]      0.0941       0.292            0           1         3.54
    gamma[3]      0.0939       0.292            0           1         3.54
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

In this case, the standard output isn't all that useful as a summary
of the variable selection. A more useful output, giving the 10 most
likely models ordered by decreasing posterior probabilities, is
available using the output function in the \code{StochasticSearch}
class. This can be called by using the \code{custom} argument to
\code{output}:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
ms.output(custom = SSVS.output)
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
Most likely models ordered by decreasing posterior probability

------------------------------------------------------------
probability | model       
------------------------------------------------------------
0.09353333  | 0, 12       
0.0504      | 0, 11, 12   
0.026       | 0, 10, 12   
0.01373333  | 0, 9, 12    
0.01353333  | 0, 8, 12    
0.013       | 0, 4, 12    
0.01293333  | 0, 12, 19   
0.01206667  | 0, 7, 12    
0.01086667  | 0, 11, 12, 17
0.01086667  | 0, 12, 17   
------------------------------------------------------------
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

As indicated earlier, the MCMC analysis is conducted using 20000
iterations, of which the first 5000 are discarded. The estimation
takes 7.4 seconds in total.  The results indicate that a model
containing variable 12 along with a constant (indicated in the table
by 0) is the most likely (prob = 0.09). Furthermore, variable 12 is
contained in each of the 10 most likely models, indicating its strong
association with crop yield.

Following the variable selection procedure, we may wish to fit a
regression to the most likely model. This can be done using the
\code{BayesRegression} class. First, extract the explanatory variables
from the most likely model:
\begin{Code}
txmat = SSVS.extract_regressors(0)
\end{Code}
and fit the model using the desired prior:
\begin{Code}
g_prior = ['g_prior', 0.0, 100.]
breg = BayesRegression(yvec,txmat,prior = g_prior)
\end{Code}

The output summarises the fit:
\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
breg.output()
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}

log marginal likelihood = nan         
BIC  = 21.32       
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The parameter associated with variable 12, $\hat{\beta_{1}}$, is
estimated as a positive value, 0.7587, with a 95\% credible interval
{[}0.7139,~0.8035{]}. We note that zero is not contained in the
credible interval, hence the crop yield increases with higher values
of variable 12. The marginal posterior densities
(Figure~\ref{Flo:mpdreg}) can be created using
\begin{Code}
breg.plot()
\end{Code}

This clearly shows this effect is far from zero. %

\subsection{Example 2: Log-linear model}
\label{sub:Example-2:-Log-linear}

The data analysed in this example are the number of nutgrass shoots
counted, in randomly scattered quadrats, at weekly intervals, during
the growing season. A log linear model is used; \begin{equation}
  \log(\mbox{count})=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\mbox{week}\end{equation}
where the intercept, $\beta_{0}$, is expected to be positive in value,
as nutgrass is always present in this study site, and $\beta_{1}$ is
also expected to be positive as the population of nutgrass increases
during the growing season.

For the log-linear model, see \citet{GelmanCarlinSternRubin2004}, the
$i^{th}$ observation $y_{i}$, for $i=1,2,\dots,n$, is generated as
follows
\begin{equation}
  p(y_{i}|\mu_{i})=\frac{\mu_{i}^{y_{i}}\exp(-\mu_{i})}{\mu_{i}!},\label{eq:observation
    equation log linear model}
\end{equation} with \[
\log(\mu_{i})=\bm{x}_{i}^{T}\bm{\beta},\] where $\bm{x}_{i}^{T}$ is
the $i^{th}$row of the $\left(n\times k\right)$ matrix $\bm{X}.$

The joint posterior distribution for the unknown parameter
$\bm{\beta}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  p(\bm{\beta}|\bm{y},\bm{X})\propto p(\bm{y}|\bm{\beta},\bm{X})\times
  p(\bm{\beta}),
\label{eq:post log_linear}
\end{equation} 
where $p(\bm{y}|\bm{\beta},\bm{X})$ is the joint \emph{pdf }for
$\bm{y}$ conditional on the $\bm{\beta}$ and $\bm{X}$, and
$p(\bm{\beta})$ denotes the prior \emph{pdf }for $\bm{\beta}.$ From
Equation~\ref{eq:observation equation log linear model} it is apparent that\[
p(\bm{y}|\bm{\beta},\bm{X})=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\mu_{i}^{y_{i}}\exp(-\mu_{i})}{\mu_{i}!}.\]
A \emph{priori }we assume that \[ \bm{\beta}\sim
N(\bm{\underline{\bm{\beta}}},\bm{V}^{-1}).\]

To sample from Equation~\ref{eq:post log_linear}, a random walk MH algorithm
is implemented, where the candidate $\bm{\beta}^{*}$, at each
iteration, is sampled following \begin{equation} \bm{\beta}^{*}\sim
  N\left(\bm{\beta}^{j-1},\bm{\Omega}\right),\label{eq:candidate
    log-linear}\end{equation} where\[
\bm{\beta}^{0}=\bm{\beta}_{nls}=\arg\min\left(\bm{y}-\exp\left(\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)\right)^{2}\]
and\[
\bm{\Omega}^{-1}=-\sum_{i=1}^{n}\exp\left(\bm{x}_{i}^{T}\bm{\beta}_{nls}\right)\bm{x}_{i}\bm{x}_{i}^{T}.\]


The example code for \pkg{PyMCMC} uses two \proglang{Python}
libraries, \pkg{Numpy} and \pkg{Scipy}, which the user must have
installed to run the code.  

As before, the code begins by importing the required packages:

\begin{Code}
import os
from numpy import random, loadtxt, hstack, ones, dot, exp, zeros, outer, diag
from numpy import linalg
from pymcmc.mcmc import MCMC, RWMH, OBMC
from pymcmc.regtools import BayesRegression
from scipy.optimize.minpack import leastsq
\end{Code}

The import statements are followed by the definition of a number or
required functions.

A function \code{minfunc} used in the non-linear least squares routine:
\begin{Code}
def minfunc(beta, yvec, xmat ):
    return yvec - exp(dot(xmat, beta))
\end{Code}

A function \code{prior} to evaluate the log of the prior pdf
$\bm{\beta}.$ and a function \code{logl} defining the log-likelihood
function:

\begin{Code}
def prior(store):
    mu = zeros(store['beta'].shape[0])
    Prec = diag(0.005 * ones(store['beta'].shape[0]))
    return -0.5 * dot(store['beta'].transpose(), dot(Prec, store['beta']))

def logl(store):
    xbeta = dot(store['xmat'], store['beta'])
    lamb = exp(xbeta)
    return sum(store['yvec'] * xbeta - Lamb)
\end{Code}

As in the variable selection example, \code{store} is a
\proglang{Python} dictionary used to store all the information of
interest that needs to be accessed by functions that are called from
the MCMC sampler. For example, the function \code{logl} uses
\code{store{[}`beta'{]}} which provides access to the vector $\bm{\beta}.$

% Note the name \code{`beta'} is specified on line 72 when the class for
% the random walk MH algorithm is initialised.  

A function \code{posterior} which evaluates the log
of the posterior pdf for $\bm{\beta}$:

\begin{Code}
def posterior(store):
    return logl(store) + prior(store)
\end{Code}

A function \code{llhessian} which returns the hessian for the
log-linear model:

\begin{Code}
def llhessian(store, beta):
    nobs = store['yvec'].shape[0]
    kreg = store['xmat'].shape[1]
    lamb = exp(dot(store['xmat'], beta))
    sum = zeros((kreg, kreg))
    for i in xrange(nobs):
        sum = sum + lamb[i] * outer(store['xmat'][i], store['xmat'][i])
    return -sum
\end{Code}

Following the function definitions, the main program begins with the
command to set the random seed:
\begin{Code}
random.seed(12345)      
\end{Code}

and the set up of the data:
\begin{Code}
data = loadtxt('count.txt', skiprows = 1)
yvec = data[:, 0]
xmat = data[:, 1:data.shape[1]]
xmat = hstack([ones((data.shape[0], 1)), xmat])
data ={'yvec':yvec, 'xmat':xmat} 
\end{Code}

Bayesian regression is used to initialise the non-linear least squares
algorithm:
\begin{Code}
bayesreg = BayesRegression(yvec, xmat)
sig, beta0 = bayesreg.posterior_mean()
\end{Code}

The function \code{leastsq} from \pkg{Scipy} is used to perform the
non-linear least squares operation:

\begin{Code}
init_beta, info = leastsq(minfunc, beta0, args = (yvec, xmat))
data['betaprec'] =-llhessian(data, init_beta)
scale = linalg.inv(data['betaprec'])
\end{Code}

Initialise the random walk MH algorithm:
\begin{Code}
samplebeta = RWMH(posterior, scale, init_beta, 'beta')
\end{Code}

Finally, setup and run the sampling scheme.  Note that the sampling
algorithm is run for 20000 iterations and the first 4000 is
discarded. The MCMC scheme has only one block and is a MH sampling
scheme:

\begin{Code}
ms = MCMC(20000, 4000, data, [samplebeta], 
      loglike = (logl, xmat.shape[1], 'yvec'))
ms.sampler()
\end{Code}



% ms.output(filename='example1c.out') 
% ms.plot('beta', filename='ex_loglinear.pdf')

% ms.CODAoutput('beta')
% ms.plot('beta', elements = [0], plottypes ="trace", filename ="xx.pdf")
% ms.plot('beta', elements = [0], plottypes ="density", filename ="xx.png")
% ms.plot('beta', elements = [0], plottypes ="acf", filename ="yy.ps")


% \item Lines 54-55 produce output.
% \item Lines 57-60 demonstrate an example of how to produce CODA output
%   and different ways in which plotting may be produced.

A summary of the model fit can be produced using the \code{output} function:
\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
ms.output()
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}

--------------------------------------------------------

The time (seconds) for the Gibbs sampler =  7.47
Number of blocks in Gibbs sampler =  1

                mean        sd       2.5%     97.5%    IFactor
   beta[0]      1.14    0.0456       1.05      1.23       13.5
   beta[1]     0.157   0.00428      0.148     0.165       12.2
Acceptance rate  beta  =  0.5625
BIC =  -7718.074
Log likelihood =  3864.453
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

It can be seen from the output that estimation is very fast (7.5
seconds), and that both $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$ are positive
values, with $\hat{\beta}_{0}$ = 1.14 {[}1.05, 1.23{]} and
$\hat{\beta}_{1}$ = 0.157 {[}0.148, 0.165{]}. 

Summary plots can also be produced (Figure~\ref{fig:plot_output_eg2}):
\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
ms.plot('beta')
\end{CodeInput}
\end{CodeChunk}

The marginal posterior densities of these estimates
(Figure~\ref{fig:plot_output_eg2}) confirm that both estimates are far
from zero. The ACF plots (Figure~\ref{fig:plot_output_eg2}) and low
inefficiency factors (see \citet{ChibGreenberg1996} for details on
inefficiency factors) of 13.5 ($\hat{\beta}_{0}$) and 12.2
($\hat{\beta}_{1}$) show that autocorrelation in the sample is
relatively low for an MCMC sampler. %

\subsection{Example 3: First order autoregressive regression}
\label{sub:Example-3:-First}

The final example demonstrates first order autoregressive regression
using a simulated data set, with 1000 observations and 3 regressors.

The linear regression model, with first order autocorrelated serial
correlation in the residuals, see \citet{Zellner1971} is defined such
that the $t^{th}$ observation, $y_{t},$ for
$t=1,2,\dots,n,$
\begin{equation}
  y_{t}=\bm{x}_{t}^{T}\bm{\beta}+\varepsilon_{t},\label{eq:observation
    ar}
\end{equation} 
with
\begin{equation}
  \varepsilon_{t}=\rho\varepsilon_{t-1}+\nu_{t};\,\,\,\nu_{t}\sim
  i.i.d.N(0,\sigma^{2}),
\label{eq:error ar}
\end{equation} where
\textbf{$\bm{x}_{t}$} is a $\left(k\times1\right)$ vector of
regressors, $\bm{\beta}$ is a $\left(k\times1\right)$ vector of
regression coefficients, $\rho$ is a damping parameter and $\nu_{t}$
is an independent identically normally distributed random variable
with a mean of 0 and a variance of $\sigma^{2}.$ Under the assumption
that the process driving the errors is stationary, that is $|\rho|<1,$
and assuming that the process has been running since time immemorial
then Equation~\ref{eq:observation ar} and Equation~\ref{eq:error ar} can be
expressed as

\begin{equation}
  \bm{y}=\bm{X}\bm{\beta}+\bm{\varepsilon};\,\,\,\,\bm{\varepsilon}\sim N\left(\bm{0},\kappa^{-1}\bm{\Omega^{-1}}\right),\label{eq:observation2 ar}\end{equation}
where \[
\bm{\Omega}=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
    1 & -\rho & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
    -\rho & 1+\rho^{2} & -\rho & 0 & \ddots & 0\\
    0 & -\rho & 1+\rho^{2} & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots\\
    0 & 0 & \ddots & \ddots & -\rho & 0\\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & -\rho & 1+\rho^{2} & -\rho\\
    0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 & -\rho & 1\end{array}\right].\]
Further, if we factorise $\bm{\Omega}=\bm{L}\bm{L}^{T},$ using the
Cholesky decomposition, it is straightforward to derive $\bm{L},$
where\[
\bm{L}=\left[\begin{array}{cccccc}
    1 & -\rho & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
    0 & 1 & -\rho & \ddots & \ddots & 0\\
    0 & 0 & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots\\
    \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & 0\\
    \vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & 1 & -\rho\\
    0 & 0 & \cdots & \cdots & 0 & \sqrt{1-\rho^{2}}\end{array}\right].\]
Pre-multiplying Equation~\ref{eq:observation2 ar}, by $\bm{L}$ gives\begin{equation}
  \bm{\tilde{y}}=\bm{\tilde{X}}\bm{\beta}+\bm{\tilde{\varepsilon}},\label{eq:trans_obs_ar}\end{equation}
where $\bm{\tilde{y}}=\bm{L}^{T}\bm{y}$, $\bm{\tilde{X}}=\bm{L}^{T}\bm{X}$
and $\tilde{\bm{\varepsilon}}=\bm{L}^{T}\bm{\varepsilon}.$ Note that
$\bm{\varepsilon}\sim N(0,\kappa^{-1}\bm{I})$.

The joint posterior distribution for the full set of unknown parameters
is
\begin{equation} p(\bm{\beta},\kappa,\rho|\bm{y})\propto
  p(\bm{y}|\bm{\beta},\kappa,\rho)\times p(\bm{\beta},\kappa)\times
  p(\rho),\label{eq:post_ar}
\end{equation} where
$p(\bm{y}|\bm{\beta},\kappa,\rho)$ is the joint \emph{pdf} of $\bm{y}$
conditional on $\bm{\beta},$ $\kappa,$ and $\rho$,
$p(\bm{\beta},\kappa)$ is the joint prior \emph{pdf} for $\bm{\beta}$
and $\kappa,$ and $p(\rho)$ denotes the prior density function for
$\rho.$ The likelihood function, which is defined following
Equation~\ref{eq:observation ar} and Equation~\ref{eq:error ar} is defined as
follows
\begin{eqnarray}
  p(\bm{y}|\bm{\beta},\kappa,\rho) & \propto & \kappa^{n/2}|\bm{\Omega}|^{1/2}\exp\left\{ -\frac{\kappa}{2}\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)^{T}\bm{\Omega}\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)\right\} \nonumber \\
  & = & \kappa^{n/2}|\bm{\Omega}|^{1/2}\exp\left\{ -\frac{\kappa}{2}\left(\tilde{\bm{y}}-\tilde{\bm{X}}\bm{\beta}\right)^{T}\left(\tilde{\bm{y}}-\tilde{\bm{X}}\bm{\beta}\right)\right\} .\nonumber \\
  & = & \kappa^{n/2}\left(1-\rho^{2}\right)^{1/2}\exp\left\{
    -\frac{\kappa}{2}\left(\tilde{\bm{y}}-\tilde{\bm{X}}\bm{\beta}\right)^{T}\left(\tilde{\bm{y}}-\tilde{\bm{X}}\bm{\beta}\right)\right\}
  .
  \label{eq:Likelihood AR1}
\end{eqnarray} 
For the analysis a normal-gamma prior is assumed for $\bm{\beta}$ and
$\kappa$, such that
\begin{equation} \bm{\beta}|\kappa\sim
  N\left(\underline{\bm{\beta}},\kappa^{-1}\right),\,\,\,\,\,\kappa\sim
  G\left(\frac{\underline{\nu}}{2},\frac{\underline{S}}{2}\right).
  \label{eq:prior
    beta AR1}
\end{equation} It follows from Equation~\ref{eq:Likelihood AR1}
and Equation~\ref{eq:prior beta AR1} that sampling $\bm{\beta}$ and $\kappa$
conditional on $\rho$ is simply equivalent to sampling from a linear
regression model with a normal-gamma prior. A beta prior is assumed
for $\rho$ there by restricting the autocorrelation of the time series
to be both positive and stationary. Specifically\[
\rho\sim\mathcal{B}e\left(\alpha,\beta\right).\]

A MCMC sampling scheme, for the posterior distribution in
Equation~\ref{eq:post_ar}, defined at iteration $j$ is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sample $\bm{\beta}^{(j)},\kappa^{(j)}$ from
  $p(\bm{\beta},\kappa|\bm{y},\rho^{(j-1)}).$
\item Sample $\rho^{(j)}$ from $p(\rho|\bm{y},\bm{\beta},\kappa).$
\end{enumerate}


The code for this model follows the structure of the previous
examples, and begins by importing the required packages:


% The example code for the linear regression model, with first order
% autocorrelation in the errors uses the \proglang{Python} libraries
% \pkg{Numpy}, \pkg{Scipy} and \pkg{Pysparse}. The code is used to
% analyse simulated data.


%\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\scriptsize},numbers=left,tabsize=4]
\begin{Code}
from numpy import random, ones, zeros, dot, hstack, eye, log
from scipy import sparse
from pysparse import spmatrix
from pymcmc.mcmc import MCMC, SliceSampler, RWMH, OBMC, MH, CFsampler
from pymcmc.regtools import BayesRegression 
\end{Code}

As this example uses simulated data the first function is used to
derive this data:

\begin{Code}
def simdata(nobs, kreg):
    xmat = hstack((ones((nobs, 1)), random.randn(nobs, kreg - 1)))
    beta = random.randn(kreg)
    sig = 0.2
    rho = 0.90
    yvec = zeros(nobs)
    eps = zeros(nobs)
    eps[0] = sig ** 2 / (1. - rho ** 2)
    for i in xrange(nobs - 1):
        eps[i + 1] = rho * eps[i] + sig * random.randn(1)
    yvec = dot(xmat, beta) + eps
    return yvec, xmat
\end{Code}

Next, define a function that calculates $\tilde{\bm{y}}$ and
$\bm{\tilde{X}}$:


\begin{Code}
def calcweighted(store):
    nobs = store['yvec'].shape[0]
    store['Upper'].put(-store['rho'], range(0, nobs - 1), range(1, nobs))
    store['Upper'].matvec(store['yvec'], store['yvectil'])
    for i in xrange(store['xmat'].shape[1]):
        store['Upper'].matvec(store['xmat'][:, i], store['xmattil'][:, i])

\end{Code}
 Note that $\bm{L}^{T}$ is updated based on the
latest iteration in the MCMC scheme. Further, $\bm{L}^{T}$ is stored
in the \proglang{Python} dictionary \code{store} and is accessed using
the key \code{`Upper'}. It is stored in sparse matrix format using the
library \pkg{Pysparse}.

Next define a function that is used to sample $\bm{\beta},$ from its
conditional posterior distribution:

\begin{Code}
def WLS(store):
    calcweighted(store)
    store['regsampler'].update_yvec(store['yvectil'])
    store['regsampler'].update_xmat(store['xmattil'])
    return store['regsampler'].sample()
\end{Code}

Now define functions to evaluate the log-likelihood (\code{loglike}),
the log of the prior pdf for $\rho$ (\code{prior_rho}) and a function to evaluate the log of the posterior pdf for $\rho$ (\code{post_rho}):

\begin{Code}
def loglike(store):
    nobs = store['yvec'].shape[0]
    calcweighted(store)
    store['regsampler'].update_yvec(store['yvectil'])
    store['regsampler'].update_xmat(store['xmattil'])
    return store['regsampler'].loglike(store['sigma'], store['beta'])

def prior_rho(store):
    if store['rho'] > 0. and store['rho'] < 1.0:
        alpha = 1.0
        beta = 1.0
        return (alpha - 1.) * log(store['rho']) + (beta - 1.) * \
          log(1.-store['rho'])
    else:
        return -1E256

def post_rho(store):
    return loglike(store) + prior_rho(store)
\end{Code}

% def gencand(store):
%     return store['rho'] + 0.02 * random.randn(1)[0]

% def probcandgprev(store):
%     res = store['rho'] - Store['previous_rho']
%     return -0.5/(0.02**2) * res**2

% def probprevgcand(store):
%     return probcandgprev(store)

The main program begins by setting the seed and constructing the
\proglang{Python} dictionary \code{data}, which is used to store
information that will be passed to functions that are called from the
MCMC sampler:

\begin{Code}
random.seed(12345)
nobs = 1000
kreg = 3
yvec, xmat = simdata(nobs, kreg)
priorreg = ('g_prior', zeros(kreg), 1000.0)
regs = BayesRegression(yvec, xmat, prior = priorreg)
data ={'yvec':yvec, 'xmat':xmat, 'regsampler':regs}
U = spmatrix.ll_mat(nobs, nobs, 2 * nobs - 1)
U.put(1.0, range(0, nobs), range(0, nobs))
data['yvectil'] = zeros(nobs)
data['xmattil'] = zeros((nobs, kreg))
data['Upper'] = U
\end{Code}

Initial values for $\sigma$ and $\beta$ are set using Bayesian regression:
\begin{Code}
bayesreg = BayesRegression(yvec, xmat)
sig, beta = bayesreg.posterior_mean()
\end{Code}

The parameters $\sigma$ and $\beta$ are jointly sampled using the
closed form class:
\begin{Code}
simsigbeta = CFsampler(WLS, [sig, beta], ['sigma', 'beta'])
\end{Code}

The parameter $\rho$ is sampled using the Slice Sampler, with initial value 0.9:
%scale = 0.002                       
\begin{Code}
rho = 0.9
simrho = SliceSampler([post_rho], 0.1, 5, rho, 'rho')
\end{Code}

In this example, there are two blocks in the MCMC sampler. The code:
\begin{Code}
blocks = [simrho, simsigbeta]
\end{Code}
constructs a \proglang{Python} list that contains the
class instances that define the MCMC sampler. In particular, it
implies that the MCMC sampler consists of two blocks. Further,
$\rho$ will be the first element sampled in the MCMC scheme.


Finally, the sampler can be initialised and sampling undertaken:

\begin{Code}
loglikeinfo = (loglike, kreg + 2, 'yvec')
ms = MCMC(10000, 2000, data, blocks, loglike = loglikeinfo)
ms.sampler()
\end{Code}


The MCMC sampler is run for 10000
iterations and the first 2000 are discarded. A summary can be generated by the \code{output} command:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
ms.output()
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
The time (seconds) for the Gibbs sampler =  27.72
Number of blocks in Gibbs sampler =  2

                mean        sd       2.5%     97.5%    IFactor
   beta[0]    -0.523    0.0716     -0.653    -0.373        3.5
   beta[1]      1.85   0.00508       1.84      1.86       3.56
   beta[2]     0.455   0.00505      0.445     0.465       3.75
     sigma     0.217   0.00489      0.207     0.226        3.5
       rho     0.901    0.0155      0.872     0.932       3.67

Acceptance rate  beta  =  1.0
Acceptance rate  sigma  =  1.0
Acceptance rate  rho  =  1.0
BIC =  -331.398
Log likelihood =   182.969

\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}


The total time of estimation is approximately 28 seconds. From the
inefficiency factors it is clear that the algorithm is very efficient.

Summary plots generated using \code{ms.plot(`rho')}
(Figure~\ref{Flo:AR1}) provide the marginal posterior density,
autocorrelation plot and the trace plot for the iterates.

\section[Using PyMCMC  efficiently]{Using \pkg{PyMCMC}  efficiently}
\label{sec:Using-PyMCMC-efficiently}

The fact that MCMC algorithms rely on a large number of iterations to
achieve reasonable results and are often implemented on very large
problems, limits the practitioner's choice of a suitable environment, in
which they can implement efficient code. This efficiency comes through
an understanding of what makes a simulation efficient MCMC sampler,
and also the ability to produce computationally efficient code.
Interestingly, the two are related. To achieve both simulation and
computationally efficient code in MCMC samplers it is often extremely
important that large numbers of parameters are sampled in blocks,
rather than the alternative of a single move sampler. From the
perspective of simulation efficiency it is well known that individually
sampling correlated parameters induces correlation in the resultant
Markov chain and thus leads to a poorly mixing sampler. A classic
example in the literature uses \emph{simulation smoothers }to jointly
sample the state vector in a state space model; see for example
\citet{CarterKohn1994} and \citet{deJongShepard1995}.  Whilst
implementing a simulation smoother is required to achieve simulation
efficient code, the sequential nature of their implementation often
renders higher level languages impractical for large problems and thus
forces the analyst to write their entire code in a lower level
language. This is an inefficient use of time as usually only a small
percentage of code needs to be optimised. This drawback is easily
circumvented in \pkg{PyMCMC} as \proglang{Python} makes it easy to use
a lower level language to write the specialised module and use the
functions directly from \proglang{Python}. This ensures \pkg{PyMCMC}'s
modules can be used for rapid development from \proglang{Python} and
lower level languages are only resorted to when necessary.

This section aims to provide guidelines for producing efficient code
with \pkg{PyMCMC}. We discuss alternative external libraries that are
available to the user for producing efficient code using \pkg{PyMCMC}.
Despite the ease of writing specialised modules this should not be the
first resort of the user. Instead, one should ensure that the
\proglang{Python} code is as efficient as possible using the resources
available with \proglang{Python}.

Arguably, the first thing the user of \pkg{PyMCMC} should concentrate
on when optimising their \pkg{PyMCMC} code is to ensure they use as
many inbuilt functions and libraries as possible. As most high
performance libraries are written in \proglang{C} or
\proglang{Fortran} this ensures that computationally expensive
procedures are computed using code from compiled languages.
\proglang{Python} users, and hence \pkg{PyMCMC} users, have an
enormous resource of Scientific libraries available to them as a
result of the popularity of \proglang{Python} in the scientific
community. Two of the most important libraries for most users will
quite possibly be \pkg{Numpy} and \pkg{Scipy}. Making use of such
libraries is one of the best ways of avoiding large loops in
procedures that are called from the MCMC sampler. If a large loop is
used inside a function that is called from inside the MCMC sampler
then this could mean that a large proportion of the total computation
is being done by \proglang{Python}, rather than a library that was
generated from optimised compiled code. This can have a dramatic
effect on the total computation time. As a simple and somewhat trivial
example we modify Example 2 from Section \ref{sub:Example-2:-Log-linear}
so that a loop is explicitly used to calculate the log likelihood.




%\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\scriptsize}]
\begin{Code}
def logl(store):
    suml=0.0
    for i in xrange(store['yvec'].shape[0]):
        xbeta=dot(store['xmat'][i,:],store['beta'])
        suml=suml+store['yvec'][i] * xbeta - Exp(xbeta)
    return suml
\end{Code}

Whilst the two functions to calculate the log-likelihood are
mathematically equivalent, the one with the explicit loop is
substantially slower.  Specifically, the time taken for the MCMC
sampler went from 7.3 seconds to 130.19 seconds. As such, this minor
modification leads to an approximate 18-fold decrease in the speed of
the program.

If the use of an an inbuilt function is not possible and the time
taken from the program is unacceptable then there are several
alternative solutions available to the user. One such solution is to
use the package \pkg{Weave}, which is a part of the \pkg{Scipy}
library, to write inline \proglang{C} code which will accelerate the
problem area in the code. An example is given below.


%\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\scriptsize}]
\begin{Code}
def logl(store):
    code = """     
		double sum = 0.0, xbeta;
		for(int i=0; i<nobs; i++){
			xbeta = 0.0;
			for(int j=0; j<kreg; j++){
                          xbeta += xmat(i,j) * beta(j);
                        }
			sum += yvec(i) * xbeta - exp(xbeta);
		}     
		return_val = sum;
    """
    yvec = store['yvec']
    xmat = store['xmat']
	nobs, kreg = xmat.shape
	beta = store['beta']
    return weave.inline(code,['yvec','xmat', 'beta','nobs','kreg'],\ 
                       compiler='gcc',type_converters=converters.blitz)
\end{Code}

The total time taken for \pkg{Weave} version is 4.33 seconds. The reason for
the speed increase over the original version that uses \pkg{Numpy}
functions is the \pkg{Weave} version avoids the construction of temporary
matrices that are typically a by product of overloaded operators.

Another alternative, which is our preferred approach, is to use the
\proglang{Python} module \pkg{F2py}; see \citet{F2PY} for further
details. \pkg{F2py} allows for the seamless integration of
\proglang{Fortran} and \proglang{Python} code. Following on using the
same trivial example we use the following \proglang{Fortran77} code.
This example requires that the user have basic linear algebra
subprograms (\pkg{BLAS}) and preferably also the automatically tuned
linear algebra software (\pkg{ATLAS}).\\
 
%\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\scriptsize}]
\begin{Code}
c     fortran 77 code used to calculate the likelihood of a log
c     linear model. Subroutine uses BLAS.

      subroutine logl(xb,xm,bv,yv,llike,n,k)
      implicit none
      integer n, k, i, j
      real*8 xb(n),xm(n,k), bv(k), yv(n), llike
      real*8 alpha, beta

cf2py intent(in,out) logl
cf2py intent(in) yv
cf2py intent(in) bv
cf2py intent(in) xmat 
cf2py intent(in) xb 

      alpha=1.0
      beta=0.0
      call dgemv('n',n,k,alpha,xm,n,bv,1,beta,xb,1)

      llike=0.0
      do i=1,n
          llike=llike+yv(i)*xb(i)-exp(xb(i))
      enddo
      end
\end{Code}


In UNIX type environments, such as Linux and OSX the code is compiled
with the following command (Windows users see Section
\ref{CompilingWindows}):

\begin{Code}
f2py -c loglinear.f -m loglinear -lblas -latlas
\end{Code}

The loglinear library can then be imported as a python module, and the function \code{logl} accessed as a standard python function:

\begin{CodeChunk}
\begin{CodeInput}
import loglinear
print loglinear.logl.__doc__
\end{CodeInput}
\begin{CodeOutput}
logl - Function signature:
  llike = logl(xb,xm,bv,yv,llike,[n,k])
Required arguments:
  xb : input rank-1 array('d') with bounds (n)
  xm : input rank-2 array('d') with bounds (n,k)
  bv : input rank-1 array('d') with bounds (k)
  yv : input rank-1 array('d') with bounds (n)
  llike : input float
Optional arguments:
  n := len(xb) input int
  k := shape(xm,1) input int
Return objects:
  llike : float
\end{CodeOutput}
\end{CodeChunk}

Note that this function requires as input \code{xb} a rank-1 array of length
\code{n}. We add this to the \code{data} dictionary:
\begin{Code}
data['xb']=zeros(yvec.shape[0])
\end{Code}
The array \code{data{[}`xb'{]}} is a work array used for the
calculation of $\bm{X}\bm{\beta}.$ As it is stored in the
\proglang{Python} dictionary \code{data} it is only created once
rather that each time the function \code{logl} is called.

It is useful to pass arrays stored in column major order to \pkg{F2py}
functions since this is what is used in \proglang{Fortran}, rather
than the \proglang{Python} default, which is row major order the
default for the \proglang{C} programming language. This can be
achieved using the \pkg{Numpy} function \code{asfortranarray}:
\begin{Code}
data['xmatf']=asfortranarray(xmat)
\end{Code}
If \code{store{[}`xmat'{]}} were passed to the function
\code{loglinear.logl} then \pkg{F2py} will automatically produce a
copy and convert it to column major order each time the function
\code{logl} is called.

The function \code{logl} can now be rewritten as:

\begin{Code}
import loglinear
def logl(store):
	loglike=array(0.0)     
	return loglinear.logl(store['xb'],store['xmatf'], 
                  store['beta'],store['yvec'],loglike)
\end{Code}

The total time for the MCMC sampler when using \pkg{F2py} is 4.03 seconds.
This is slightly faster that the version that uses \pkg{Weave}, where most
likely the small gain can be attributed to the use of \pkg{ATLAS}.

The user has many other choices available to them for writing
specialised extension modules. For example, if it is the preference of
the user it is not much more difficult to use \pkg{F2py} to compile
procedures written in \proglang{C}, which then can be used directly
from \proglang{Python}. Another popular library that can be used to
marry \proglang{C}, as well as \proglang{C++}, code with
\proglang{Python} is \pkg{SWIG}. In our opinion \pkg{SWIG} is more
difficult than \pkg{f2py} for complicated examples. The user may also
opt to manually call \proglang{C} and \proglang{C++} routines using
\proglang{Python} and \pkg{Numpy}'s \proglang{C} application
interface. Another option for \proglang{C++} users is to use
\pkg{Boost} \proglang{Python}. These alternative approaches are beyond
the scope of this paper.


\subsection{Compiling code in Windows}
\label{CompilingWindows}

The previous section described how one might go about using
\pkg{PyMCMC} efficiently. To do this, access to a compiler is
necessary. Under most flavours of UNIX, this should pose no problem,
but under Microsoft Windows this can be more difficult. This section
provides some brief guidelines to an approach we found workable under
Windows.

In order to run \pkg{PyMCMC}, \proglang{Python}, \pkg{Numpy} and
\pkg{Scipy} are all required, but to have a reasonable developer
experience under Windows, we suggest a few additional packages, all of
which are freely available:
\begin{itemize}
\item \pkg{mingw} (http://www.mingw.org/) which provides, among other
  things, the GNU compiler suite. The user should choose at least
  \pkg{gcc} and \pkg{g++}.
\item \pkg{msys} (http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS) which provides a set
  of GNU utilities commonly found on Linux. This will make building
  and compiling code more manageable under Windows.
\item \pkg{ipython} (http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/), an interactive
  interface to \proglang{Python}, which can be used as an alternative
  to the idle interface that is distributed with \proglang{Python}.
\item \pkg{pyreadline}
  (http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/PyReadline/Intro), which provides
  Windows readline capabilities for \pkg{IPython}.
\item \pkg{gfortran} (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries), which
  provides a native Windows \proglang{Fortran} compiler.
\end{itemize}
Once these additional utilities are installed, it should be possible
to compile code in different languages. To test that \pkg{Weave} works
as expected, make sure that the \pkg{mingw} bin directory is in your
path, and try the following code:


%\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\scriptsize}]
\begin{Code}
import scipy.weave 
a=100 
scipy.weave.inline('printf("a=%d\\n",a);',['a'],verbose=1)
\end{Code}


The output should be similar to:


%\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\scriptsize}]
\begin{Code}
In [4]: scipy.weave.inline('printf("a=%d\\n",a);',['a'],verbose=1)
<weave: compiling>
No module named msvccompiler in numpy.distutils; trying from distutils
Compiling code...
Found executable c:\mingw\bin\g++.exe
finished compiling (sec):  2.73600006104
a=100
\end{Code}


\pkg{F2py} requires a \proglang{Fortran} compiler. To set this up
under Windows, follow the instructions at
http://www.scipy.org/F2PY\_Windows, and make sure the simple example
provided works on your system. The examples presented above
additionally require \pkg{BLAS} or \mbox{\pkg{ATLAS}} to be available.
This can be built under windows (see instructions at \linebreak
http://www.scipy.org/Installing\_SciPy/Windows, for example). To check
that \pkg{F2py} and \mbox{\pkg{ATLAS}} are installed correctly, save
the following code as, for example, \code{blas\_eg.f90}:


%\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\scriptsize}]
\begin{Code}
subroutine dgemveg()
  REAL*8 X(2, 3) /1.D0, 2.D0, 3.D0, 4.D0, 5.D0, 6.D0/
  REAL*8 Y(3) /2.D0, 2.D0, 2.D0/
  REAL*8 Z(2)
  CALL DGEMV('N', 2, 3, 1.D0, X, 2, Y, 1, 0.D0, Z, 1)
  PRINT *, Z
end subroutine dgemveg
\end{Code}



Set the location of your \pkg{ATLAS} libraries appropriately, and ensure
that \pkg{gfortran} is in your path and compile. The following provides a
template:


\begin{Code}
ATLAS_LIB_DIR="/d/tmp/pymcmc_win_install/BUILDS/lib"
export PATH=${PATH}:\
/c/Program\ Files/gfortran/libexec/gcc/i586-pc-mingw32/4.6.0:\
/c/Program\ Files/gfortran/bin:/c/python26 
python /c/Python26/Scripts/f2py.py -c -m foo \
   --fcompiler=gfortran \
   blas_eg.f90 -L${ATLAS_LIB_DIR} -lf77blas -latlas -lg2c 
\end{Code}


This should produce a \proglang{Python} dll (\code{foo.pyd}), which can be imported
into \proglang{Python}:


\begin{Code}
import foo
dir(foo) 
print foo.__doc__
foo.dgemveg() 
\end{Code}

\section[PyMCMC interacting with R]{\pkg{PyMCMC} 
interacting with \proglang{R}}
\label{sec:PyMCMC-interacting-with}

There are many functions from the \proglang{R} statistical language
\citep{R} that can be useful in Bayesian analysis. The \pkg{RPy2}
\citep{gautier:_rpy2} \proglang{Python} library can be used to
integrate \proglang{R} functions into \pkg{PyMCMC} programs. These can
be accessed in \pkg{PyMCMC} through the \pkg{RPy2} \proglang{Python}
library. As an example, consider the log linear model described in
Section \ref{sub:Example-2:-Log-linear}. The random walk MH requires
the specification of a candidate density function Equation~\ref{random
  walk candidate} and an initial value. The \proglang{R} functions
\texttt{glm }and \texttt{summary.glm} can be used to set this to the
maximum likelihood estimate $\hat{\beta}$ and the unscaled estimated
covariance matrix of the estimated coefficients. The relevant code is
summarised below:


\begin{Code}

import rpy2.robjects as robjects

def initial_values(yvec,xmat):
    ry = robjects.FloatVector(yvec)
    rv = robjects.FloatVector(xmat[:,1:].flatten())
    rx = robjects.r['matrix'](rv, nrow=xmat.shape[0],
                              byrow=True)
    robjects.globalenv['y'] = ry
    robjects.globalenv['x'] = rx
    mod = robjects.r.glm("y~x", family="poisson")
    init_beta =  array(robjects.r.coefficients(mod))
    modsummary = robjects.r.summary(mod)
    scale = array(modsummary.rx2('cov.unscaled'))
    return init_beta,scale


random.seed(12345) 
data=loadtxt('count.txt',skiprows=1)
yvec=data[:,0]
xmat=data[:,1:data.shape[1]]
xmat=hstack([ones((data.shape[0],1)),xmat])

data={'yvec':yvec,'xmat':xmat} 

init_beta,scale=initial_values(yvec,xmat)

samplebeta=RWMH(posterior,scale,init_beta,'beta')
ms=MCMC(20000,4000,data, [samplebeta],loglike=(logl,xmat.shape[1],'yvec'))
ms.sampler()
ms.CODAoutput(filename="loglinear_eg", parameter="beta") 

\end{Code}


It may also be useful to take advantage of the many MCMC analysis
functions in \proglang{R} and associated packages. To facilitate this,
\pkg{PyMCMC} includes a \pkg{CODA}
\citep{Rnews:Plummer+Best+Cowles+Vines:2006} output format which can
easily be read into \proglang{R} for further analysis. A sample
\proglang{R} session after \pkg{PyMCMC} might look like:


\begin{Code}
library(coda)
aa <- read.coda("loglinear_eg.txt","loglinear_eg.ind")
plot(aa)
summary(aa)
raftery.diag(aa)
xyplot(aa)
densityplot(aa)
acfplot(aa,lag.max=500)

\end{Code}



\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

In this paper, we describe the \proglang{Python} software
package \pkg{PyMCMC}.  \pkg{PyMCMC} takes advantage of the flexibility
and extensibility of \proglang{Python} to provide the user with a code
efficient way of constructing MCMC samplers. The \pkg{PyMCMC} package
includes classes for the MCMC sampler MH, independent MH, random walk
MH, OBMC and slice sampling algorithms.  It also contains an inbuilt
module for Bayesian regression analysis.  We demonstrate \pkg{PyMCMC}
using an example of Bayesian regression analysis with stochastic
search variable selection, a log-linear model and also a time series
regression analysis with first order autoregressive errors. We
demonstrate how to optimise \pkg{PyMCMC} using \pkg{Numpy} functions,
inline \proglang{C} code using \pkg{Weave} and with
\proglang{Fortran77} using \pkg{F2py}, where necessary.  We further
demonstrate how to call \proglang{R} functions using \pkg{RPy2}.
